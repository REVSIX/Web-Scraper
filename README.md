This branch was created as a supplemental place for me to document my progress as I learned numerous web scraping concepts, 
which assisted me in completing the web scraping project I completed as a coding problem for social media scraping and data analysis.

I utilized a free internet crash course from JimShapedCoding on freecodecamp.org. Below is the link to follow along!

You'll see I made slight edits to fit my own personal preferences, but the code and concepts are entirely to his credit. 

All Code in this branch of the repository is completely open for any use. 

Check out JimShapedCoding on his Github Repository:

Enjoy!
